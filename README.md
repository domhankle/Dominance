## Dominance

Dominance is going to be a "Game Engine" that I will utilize in future games I develop. I say "Game Engine" because I don't know how extensive it will actually become.

Under the hood, Dominance contains the SFML library, which you can find under the `deps` directory.

## Developer Requirements

Currently, Dominance development is only supported on Ubuntu. For developers with Windows machines, they can develop on Dominance through WSL.
Due to internal use of the SFML library, developers will need to install some dependencies for the SFML library. A dependency script is hopefully coming soon to make this easier.

Here are the current dependencies needed by developers:

`libxcursor` - Can be installed through `sudo apt-get install libxcursor-dev`

## Third Party Libraries used in Dominance

`SFML-2.6.1`
`googletest`
